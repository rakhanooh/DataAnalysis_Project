Stop buying toxic ingredients as a form of \\\"survival\\\" food. It's moronic. If you're trying to store some food to keep you ALIVE, don't buy foods laced with chemicals that are designed to KILL (such as pesticides and herbicides). I will be announcing a clean, certified organic, laboratory verified preparedness food line in just two days This project took six months longer than planned, but it's finally ready.

he might quit in the midst of a controversy over his latest tirades of obscene threatening and racially charged remarks as republican lawmakers in the house rallied to quash the possibility of formally rebuking him  \\u2014   or worse  \\u2014   for his erratic behavior gov paul r lepage whose tenure here has often seemed to lurch from one   crisis to another began the day by suggesting in a radio interview tuesday morning that he was considering stepping down as the outrage generated by a profane voice mail and his apparent endorsement of racial profiling drew admonishments even from members of his party its really one thing to have one party behind you mr lepage said on the radio in an interview that was at times uncharacteristically   its another thing not to have any party behind you  but in the early afternoon in a twitter message mr lepage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance regarding rumors of resignation to paraphrase mark twain \\u2018the reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated the message read mr lepage was spending much of the day in the town of baileyville  miles from here near the canadian border by nighttime it was clear there was a basis for the governors renewed swagger as house republican leaders said they would not join the calls to convene a special session which would have raised the possibility of impeachment we believe that the governor is addressing this issue said state representative kenneth fredette an ally of mr lepages and the minority leader of the house we are not interested in coming back in a special session  speaking with reporters after the caucus meeting mr fredette condemned mr lepages remarks  \\u2014   no one agrees with what the governor said or did he said  \\u2014   and asserted that no one gets a free pass  but he then seemed to give one to mr lepage saying that a special session would distract voters from important issues ahead of the fall election since he was elected in  and   in  mr lepage has had at least nine political lives and been able to ride out waves of controversy often provoked by his harsh insulting and racially charged statements the outbursts have angered democrats and embarrassed moderate republicans yet left largely unruffled a political base drawn to the former businessmans unfiltered style democrats and some senate republicans raised the possibility of a special session to consider ways to rebuke the governor but such a session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucuses in each legislative chamber the house republican caucus held the line after meeting at  p m the caucus meeting followed days of controversy after mr lepage stated at a   meeting last wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealers in maine were black and hispanic as criticism swelled mr lepage came to believe that a democratic lawmaker drew gattine had called him a racist and left him a threatening voice mail threaded with obscenities which he followed by suggesting that he and mr gattine have a duel on friday mr lepage reiterated his comments about drugs and race showing reporters a binder of people arrested on drug charges and asserting that black and hispanic people from out of state were the enemy  those comments led amy volk a republican in the senate to make a public break with mr lepage questioning his sanity and sobriety in a facebook post although she later apologized for doing so she called for a special legislative session to consider a censure of mr lepage its just so nonproductive ms volk said in an interview on tuesday and so offensive to   citizens of color that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin  democratic leaders said they would continue to call for the governors resignation what the house republicans have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time said jeff mccabe the democratic majority leader of the house on tuesday night we think that we can work with senate republicans as well as some house republicans who we know are not happy with tonights display of political theater  mr lepage met with republican legislative leaders on monday when he was urged to take steps like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened and was asked to seek help professional or otherwise according to a person briefed on the discussions during his interview on the radio station wvom mr lepage said he just cant do some of the senate republicans demands although he did not specify which ones he added that republican lawmakers in the   house want to salvage what we can and move forward  he went on to say that he was looking at options conceding that his remarks had cost him crucial support if ive lost my ability to convince the maine people thats what we need and thats the type of people we need in augusta then you know maybe it is time to move on he said his later twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down on the radio he also apologized for his behavior toward mr gattine calling it totally totally unnecessary although in an interview with local television that afternoon he suggested that mr gattine owed an apology to him in the mornings radio interview he also defended his comments on drugs and race saying linking the two were fact and adding all lives matter  every drug arrest we get the story and the people and when it comes to meth labs theyre essentially all maine white people mr lepage said when it comes to the heroin epidemic its just the opposite  the imbroglio seems to have strengthened some republicans commitment to mr lepage in some parts of the state in lewiston on monday night a bartender and a patron   when they realized they both still supported the governor but it has left those who associate more strongly with the states tradition of moderate republicans like senator susan collins or margaret chase smith trying to explain his actions it seems to be the norm now to speak whats on your mind now without a filter said wendy ault a former republican state representative and a member of the early college task force appointed by mr lepage adding i believe in civilized discourse \",\n          \"albuquerque  \\u2014   after two full days of deliberations a jury here announced on tuesday that it had failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial of two former police officers for the  shooting death of a homeless man with paranoid schizophrenia police officers have a very difficult job the special prosecutor randi mcginn said after the announcement the discussion we need to have as a community is do we want a dirty harry or do we want a peace officer this is the discussion we need to have here in albuquerque  after polling the six men and six women on the jury judge alisa hadfield declared a mistrial it was not immediately clear if prosecutors would seek another trial the two former officers keith sandy and dominique perez had each faced a   murder charge in the shooting of the man james boyd who had been illegally camping on a craggy mountainside on the citys east end mr sandy also faced a lesser charge of aggravated battery these are two good men sam bregman one of the defense lawyers said after the announcement let these two good men get on with their lives  the case went to the jury on thursday after  days of testimony halfway through the trial judge hadfield granted a defense motion to dismiss voluntary manslaughter charges against mr sandy and mr perez ruling that prosecutors had failed to provide enough evidence to support the charge the case highlighted the challenges posed by the growing number of people with severe mental disorders who in the absence of adequate mental health services become entangled with the police these officers have suffered the consequences of decisions by elected official to not allocate sufficient resources for the mentally ill mr bregman argued in his closing statement testifying that they used their training to guide the decisions they made on march   both former officers took the stand in their own defense  \\u2014   a rarity because of the risks it carries said douglas colbert a professor at the university of marylands francis king carey school of law who has written extensively about police misconduct police testimony could eliminate a jurors uncertainty and lead to conviction professor colbert said on the other hand the officer may gain sympathy from the juror who now understands the officers tough   decision to make or subjective fear or danger  much of the encounter was registered on body and helmet cameras worn by some of the officers including mr perez the video when released prompted large street protests here only three of the  jurors voted to convict the officers ms mcginn said the division among them mirrored the split in the community where some saw the actions in the video as justified and others did not by the time the two officers arrived at the standoff with mr boyd the episode had been going on for more than two hours his conversations with police officers had ranged from calm and humorous to delusional holding a pocketknife in each hand mr boyd repeatedly said that he had worked for the defense department and that he could get the officers killed with a phone call  in his testimony mr perez  drew a distinction between the images registered by his helmet camera and the encounter as he experienced it using still frames from the video as his guide when he arrived at  p m mr perez said mr boyd went from calm to threatening almost instantaneously and he refused to obey orders to drop the knives and get on the ground going frame by frame like that were able to pick apart every little detail mr perez said the way it happened that day it happened in the blink of an eye at the speed of life  he told ms mcginn that he never saw mr boyd lunge toward the officers but that he had a feeling he was going to lunge forward  that distinction framed ms mcginns closing argument the trial she told jurors was ultimately about the   argument that anticipatory shootings are justifiable and the modern  version that the police may not shoot unless someone is in fact attacking them society gives police officers a tremendous amount of power ms mcginn said we give them guns  \\u2014   not just side arms but long guns  \\u2014   and we give them a license to kill but it is a limited license  officers had hastily devised a plan to subdue mr boyd before dark but nothing appeared to go as expected he stood unfazed when a   grenade exploded near him mr perez testified that from where he stood mr boyd seemed to be within arms reach of a k9 officer scott weimerskirch who was retrieving his dog mr boyd was in fact  feet away mr perez said he saw mr boyd move a hand toward his waistband and perceived an immediate deadly threat  mr sandy who was standing behind officer weimerskirch said mr boyd pulled out his knives and took a slight step to the left he was going to try to flank us mr sandy  testified he was going to attack us from a different angle thats when i made the decision to shoot  mr sandy and mr perez each fired three shots striking mr boyd in the arms and back as he turned away from the officers his backpack slung on his shoulder mr sandy retired after the shooting and mr perez was fired during the trial ms mcginn portrayed mr sandy differently from mr perez she began her   of mr perez by thanking him for his service  \\u2014   he is a decorated iraq war veteran who had a spotless record with the albuquerque police until mr boyds shooting i cant tell you how sorry i am that you were sent up there into the mess some other officer created she told him in contrast she portrayed mr sandy as an officer with a tarnished record whose actions fueled the confrontation mr sandy spent time on the stand discussing his firing from the new mexico state police in  after he was caught moonlighting while on the job he also apologized for saying that he was going to shoot mr boyd with a taser shotgun almost as soon as he arrived at the scene\",\n          \"  pm est soros funds antitrump army of liberals to fight hate crime washington dc  intellihub  \\u2014 billionaire

No injuries have been declared or deaths at the time of this writing.\\nThe flight was initially delayted because of unknown problems at LaGuardia, giving Pence time to toss the football around while stranded on the tarmac in Iowa, and tweet this photo reported Fox6. \\n(THIS IS A BREAKING, DEVELOPING STORY AND UPDATES WILL BE ADDED AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.)\\nThe post BREAKING: Plane Carrying U.S. VP Candidate MIKE PENCE Slides Off The Runway appeared first on We Are Change .\\n\",\n          \"The Drought That Was Prophesied To Hit The Southern United States Is Now Here   15th, 2016 \\nA record-setting drought has gripped the southern United States, but most people have no idea that this drought is the fulfillment of a prophecy that was given four years ago. Back in 2008, John Paul Jackson released a DVD entitled \\u201c The Perfect Storm \\u201d in which he detailed many of the prophetic events that God showed him would soon come to America. In 2012, he released a video update to \\u201cThe Perfect Storm\\u201d that you can view on YouTube right here . In that update, he shared a list of future headlines that God had revealed to him over the years. Some of these headlines have already happened since that time, and now we are watching another be fulfilled right in front of our eyes. \\nSpecifically, I am referring to this headline: \\u201cRecord High Temps Accompany Record Drought Swept South\\u201d . \\nIn an article entitled \\u201c July\\u2019s Extreme Heat Breaks Records Across South \\u201c, weather.com detailed many of the high temperature records that have been broken in the South in recent months, but in this article I am going to focus on the crippling drought that is plaguing the region. \\nIn addition to the headline above, John Paul Jackson was shown several other headlines regarding drought and famine coming to America\\u2026 \\n\\u201cDrought Continues to Cause Prayer to Rise\\u201d \\n\\u201cDemand for Classic Seeds Skyrockets\\u201d \\n\\u201cFood Prices Lead Nation\\u2019s Escalating Inflation Woes\\u201d \\n\\u201cSysco and Kraft Consider Guards on Delivery Trucks as Food Nears 40% of the Family Budget\\u201d \\nAnd of course John Paul Jackson is not the only one that has been shown that these things are coming to this nation. \\nThe following is a very small portion of what Terry Bennett was shown in April 2011 \\u2026 \\nI was also warned, by the appearing of the black horse and its rider, about famine. The angel said, \\u201cThere will be a famine of food in your nation!\\u201d Not only this, but also the prices of food, particularly grains, will dramatically rise. We will see not only shortages and high prices, but I was shown significant starvation occurring during this time. Death followed this black horse! \\nDr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories of Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and she was also shown that famine is going to hit America \\u2026 \\n\\u201cI\\u2019m instructing my children to begin to fill up their storehouses before the famine strikes just as I instructed Joseph while he was in Egypt.\\u201d \\nWith those prophecies in mind, it is extremely alarming to see what is happening all across the southern portion of the United States right now. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor , most of the southern half of the country is experiencing some level of drought at this moment\\u2026 \\nThe drought in California has been raging for quite some time, but what has surprised the experts is how dry it has been in the Southeast lately. The following is from an EcoWatch article entitled \\u201c Record-Breaking Drought and Wildfires Plague Southeast \\u201c\\u2026 \\nThe atmospheric spigots have been turned off across most of the U.S. over the last several weeks. According to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report from Nov. 10, more than 27 percent of the contiguous U.S. has been enveloped by at least moderate drought (categories D1 through D4). This is the largest percentage value in more than a year, since late October 2015 . \\nThe upward trend of the last month is worrisome given the outlook for the coming winter: Drier-than-average conditions are projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration across the southern half of the contiguous U.S., a frequent outcome during La Ni\\u00f1a winters. \\nTo say that the drought in the Southeast is severe would be a tremendous understatement. At this point, some cities in the Southeast haven\\u2019t seen any measurable rain in about 50 days \\u2026 \\nNo measurable rain (at least .01 inches) has been tallied at Birmingham\\u2019s Shuttlesworth International Airport since Sept. 18, approaching a two-month-long dry streak, topping their previous longest dry streak on record \\u2013 52 straight days \\u2013 from fall 1924. \\nNine minutes of sprinkles Nov. 4 and another bout of sprinkles on Oct. 16 has been the entirety of Birmingham\\u2019s rainfall so far this fall. \\nAnniston, Alabama, and Rome, Georgia, have dry streaks now approaching 50 days. \\nAnd unfortunately, it appears that there is not going to be any substantial rain for the region any time soon \\u2026 \\nThere are no signs of any significant rainfall through the end of the month across the Southeast, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity said. \\nThe region needs days and weeks of a steady, soaking rain to completely eliminate the drought. \\n\\u201cThings will only get worse before they get better,\\u201d Margusity explained. \\nWhenever conditions are this dry, it is inevitable that there will be wildfires. \\nRight now more than 100 major wildfires are raging across the Southeast, and some of the worst are in the mountains of North Carolina. \\nAs you read this article, more than 1,000 firefighters are battling dozens of large wildfires in the North Carolina mountains. Governor Pat McCrory is referring to these fires as \\u201c California wildfires in North Carolina \\u201c, and he is not exaggerating one bit. \\nIf what we are witnessing is truly the beginning of the fulfillment of what God showed John Paul Jackson, Terry Bennett and Patricia Green, then we should expect drought conditions to continue to intensify in the months ahead. \\nAnd as you can see above, they are saying that things will eventually get so bad that famine will strike America. \\nMost of us couldn\\u2019t imagine something like that ever happening in this nation. But these are men and women of God with very long track records. As I noted above, Dr. Patricia Green correctly prophesied the election victories by Barack Obama and Donald Trump in advance, and John Paul Jackson has a track record of correctly fulfilled prophecies that is exceedingly long. \\nAs I end this article, I also want to remind everyone of what God showed Heidi Baker regarding the future of America not too long ago \\u2026 \\nI saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell. I mean they are in shredded rags. They don\\u2019t have shoes or they have flip flops. Most of them [have] no shoes. They are hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food, not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry. \\nThese days a lot of Americans have become complacent and are feeling pretty good about things. \\nBut the events that are warned about in this article are coming, and I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3838,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ellen Brodsky\",\n          \"Helene Cooper and David E.

he might quit in the midst of a controversy over his latest tirades of obscene threatening and racially charged remarks as republican lawmakers in the house rallied to quash the possibility of formally rebuking him  \\u2014   or worse  \\u2014   for his erratic behavior gov paul r lepage whose tenure here has often seemed to lurch from one   crisis to another began the day by suggesting in a radio interview tuesday morning that he was considering stepping down as the outrage generated by a profane voice mail and his apparent endorsement of racial profiling drew admonishments even from members of his party its really one thing to have one party behind you mr lepage said on the radio in an interview that was at times uncharacteristically   its another thing not to have any party behind you  but in the early afternoon in a twitter message mr lepage seemed to have regained his spirit of defiance regarding rumors of resignation to paraphrase mark twain \\u2018the reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated the message read mr lepage was spending much of the day in the town of baileyville  miles from here near the canadian border by nighttime it was clear there was a basis for the governors renewed swagger as house republican leaders said they would not join the calls to convene a special session which would have raised the possibility of impeachment we believe that the governor is addressing this issue said state representative kenneth fredette an ally of mr lepages and the minority leader of the house we are not interested in coming back in a special session  speaking with reporters after the caucus meeting mr fredette condemned mr lepages remarks  \\u2014   no one agrees with what the governor said or did he said  \\u2014   and asserted that no one gets a free pass  but he then seemed to give one to mr lepage saying that a special session would distract voters from important issues ahead of the fall election since he was elected in  and   in  mr lepage has had at least nine political lives and been able to ride out waves of controversy often provoked by his harsh insulting and racially charged statements the outbursts have angered democrats and embarrassed moderate republicans yet left largely unruffled a political base drawn to the former businessmans unfiltered style democrats and some senate republicans raised the possibility of a special session to consider ways to rebuke the governor but such a session could be held only with the approval of half of both caucuses in each legislative chamber the house republican caucus held the line after meeting at  p m the caucus meeting followed days of controversy after mr lepage stated at a   meeting last wednesday that the vast majority of heroin dealers in maine were black and hispanic as criticism swelled mr lepage came to believe that a democratic lawmaker drew gattine had called him a racist and left him a threatening voice mail threaded with obscenities which he followed by suggesting that he and mr gattine have a duel on friday mr lepage reiterated his comments about drugs and race showing reporters a binder of people arrested on drug charges and asserting that black and hispanic people from out of state were the enemy  those comments led amy volk a republican in the senate to make a public break with mr lepage questioning his sanity and sobriety in a facebook post although she later apologized for doing so she called for a special legislative session to consider a censure of mr lepage its just so nonproductive ms volk said in an interview on tuesday and so offensive to   citizens of color that they would be somehow lumped in with people that are breaking the law just because of the color of their skin  democratic leaders said they would continue to call for the governors resignation what the house republicans have done is slammed the door on their willingness to actually address this behavior at this time said jeff mccabe the democratic majority leader of the house on tuesday night we think that we can work with senate republicans as well as some house republicans who we know are not happy with tonights display of political theater  mr lepage met with republican legislative leaders on monday when he was urged to take steps like apologizing directly to the lawmaker he had threatened and was asked to seek help professional or otherwise according to a person briefed on the discussions during his interview on the radio station wvom mr lepage said he just cant do some of the senate republicans demands although he did not specify which ones he added that republican lawmakers in the   house want to salvage what we can and move forward  he went on to say that he was looking at options conceding that his remarks had cost him crucial support if ive lost my ability to convince the maine people thats what we need and thats the type of people we need in augusta then you know maybe it is time to move on he said his later twitter message ridiculed any talk of his stepping down on the radio he also apologized for his behavior toward mr gattine calling it totally totally unnecessary although in an interview with local television that afternoon he suggested that mr gattine owed an apology to him in the mornings radio interview he also defended his comments on drugs and race saying linking the two were fact and adding all lives matter  every drug arrest we get the story and the people and when it comes to meth labs theyre essentially all maine white people mr lepage said when it comes to the heroin epidemic its just the opposite  the imbroglio seems to have strengthened some republicans commitment to mr lepage in some parts of the state in lewiston on monday night a bartender and a patron   when they realized they both still supported the governor but it has left those who associate more strongly with the states tradition of moderate republicans like senator susan collins or margaret chase smith trying to explain his actions it seems to be the norm now to speak whats on your mind now without a filter said wendy ault a former republican state representative and a member of the early college task force appointed by mr lepage adding i believe in civilized discourse \",\n          \"albuquerque  \\u2014   after two full days of deliberations a jury here announced on tuesday that it had failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial of two former police officers for the  shooting death of a homeless man with paranoid schizophrenia police officers have a very difficult job the special prosecutor randi mcginn said after the announcement the discussion we need to have as a community is do we want a dirty harry or do we want a peace officer this is the discussion we need to have here in albuquerque  after polling the six men and six women on the jury judge alisa hadfield declared a mistrial it was not immediately clear if prosecutors would seek another trial the two former officers keith sandy and dominique perez had each faced a   murder charge in the shooting of the man james boyd who had been illegally camping on a craggy mountainside on the citys east end mr sandy also faced a lesser charge of aggravated battery these are two good men sam bregman one of the defense lawyers said after the announcement let these two good men get on with their lives  the case went to the jury on thursday after  days of testimony halfway through the trial judge hadfield granted a defense motion to dismiss voluntary manslaughter charges against mr sandy and mr perez ruling that prosecutors had failed to provide enough evidence to support the charge the case highlighted the challenges posed by the growing number of people with severe mental disorders who in the absence of adequate mental health services become entangled with the police these officers have suffered the consequences of decisions by elected official to not allocate sufficient resources for the mentally ill mr bregman argued in his closing statement testifying that they used their training to guide the decisions they made on march   both former officers took the stand in their own defense  \\u2014   a rarity because of the risks it carries said douglas colbert a professor at the university of marylands francis king carey school of law who has written extensively about police misconduct police testimony could eliminate a jurors uncertainty and lead to conviction professor colbert said on the other hand the officer may gain sympathy from the juror who now understands the officers tough   decision to make or subjective fear or danger  much of the encounter was registered on body and helmet cameras worn by some of the officers including mr perez the video when released prompted large street protests here only three of the  jurors voted to convict the officers ms mcginn said the division among them mirrored the split in the community where some saw the actions in the video as justified and others did not by the time the two officers arrived at the standoff with mr boyd the episode had been going on for more than two hours his conversations with police officers had ranged from calm and humorous to delusional holding a pocketknife in each hand mr boyd repeatedly said that he had worked for the defense department and that he could get the officers killed with a phone call  in his testimony mr perez  drew a distinction between the images registered by his helmet camera and the encounter as he experienced it using still frames from the video as his guide when he arrived at  p m mr perez said mr boyd went from calm to threatening almost instantaneously and he refused to obey orders to drop the knives and get on the ground going frame by frame like that were able to pick apart every little detail mr perez said the way it happened that day it happened in the blink of an eye at the speed of life  he told ms mcginn that he never saw mr boyd lunge toward the officers but that he had a feeling he was going to lunge forward  that distinction framed ms mcginns closing argument the trial she told jurors was ultimately about the   argument that anticipatory shootings are justifiable and the modern  version that the police may not shoot unless someone is in fact attacking them society gives police officers a tremendous amount of power ms mcginn said we give them guns  \\u2014   not just side arms but long guns  \\u2014   and we give them a license to kill but it is a limited license  officers had hastily devised a plan to subdue mr boyd before dark but nothing appeared to go as expected he stood unfazed when a   grenade exploded near him mr perez testified that from where he stood mr boyd seemed to be within arms reach of a k9 officer scott weimerskirch who was retrieving his dog mr boyd was in fact  feet away mr perez said he saw mr boyd move a hand toward his waistband and perceived an immediate deadly threat  mr sandy who was standing behind officer weimerskirch said mr boyd pulled out his knives and took a slight step to the left he was going to try to flank us mr sandy  testified he was going to attack us from a different angle thats when i made the decision to shoot  mr sandy and mr perez each fired three shots striking mr boyd in the arms and back as he turned away from the officers his backpack slung on his shoulder mr sandy retired after the shooting and mr perez was fired during the trial ms mcginn portrayed mr sandy differently from mr perez she began her   of mr perez by thanking him for his service  \\u2014   he is a decorated iraq war veteran who had a spotless record with the albuquerque police until mr boyds shooting i cant tell you how sorry i am that you were sent up there into the mess some other officer created she told him in contrast she portrayed mr sandy as an officer with a tarnished record whose actions fueled the confrontation mr sandy spent time on the stand discussing his firing from the new mexico state police in  after he was caught moonlighting while on the job he also apologized for saying that he was going to shoot mr boyd with a taser shotgun almost as soon as he arrived at the scene\",\n          \"  pm est soros funds antitrump army of liberals to fight hate crime washington dc  intellihub  \\u2014 billionaire
